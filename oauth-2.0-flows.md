## 1. Client Credentials Flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant B as Application
  participant C as Authorization<br>endpoint
  note over C:Not used in client<br>credentials flow
  participant D as Token<br>endpoint
  participant E as Resource
  B->>D:Request token with application credentials
  D->>D:Verify application<br>credentials
  D->>B:Access token
  B->>E:Request resource with access token
  E->>B:Response
```

Ref: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/v2-oauth2-client-creds-grant-flow

Application credentials can be:
1. `client_secret`: symmetric shared secret
2. `client_assertion`: a JWT signed by the client certificate that is registered as credentials for the application; the token endpoint uses the registered client certificate to validate the JWT

## 2. Authorization Code Flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  actor A as User
  participant B as Application
  participant C as Authorization<br>endpoint
  participant D as Token<br>endpoint
  participant E as Resource
  A->>B:Initiate login
  B->>C:Authorization<br>code request
  C->>A:Redirect to authorization page
  A->>C:Authenticate and consent
  C->>B:Authorization code
  B->>D:Request token with authorization code
  D->>B:Access token and refresh token
  B->>E:Request resource with access token
  E->>B:Response
  loop Refresh access token
    B->>D:Request new access token with<br>refresh token before expiry
    D->>B:New access token and new refresh token
    B->>E:Request resource with new access token
  end
```

> [!Note]
>
> PKCE (below) is recommended for all application types, both public and confidential clients, and required by the Microsoft identity platform for single page apps using the authorization code flow.

> [!Note]

> Client credentials are also required by the Microsoft identity platform for confidential web apps

## 3. Authorization Code Flow with Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE)

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  actor A as User
  participant B as Application
  participant C as Authorization<br>endpoint
  participant D as Token<br>endpoint
  participant E as Resource
  A->>B:Initiate login
  B->>B:Generate code_verifier<br>and code_challenge
  note over B: code_challenge is a hash of code_verifier<br>using code_challenge_method
  B->>C:Authorization code request<br>+ code_challenge<br>+ code_challenge_method
  note over C,D:Stores code_challenge<br>+ code_challenge_method
  C->>A:Redirect to authorization page
  A->>C:Authenticate and consent
  C->>B:Authorization code
  B->>D:Request token with authorization code and code_verifier
  D->>D:Hashes code_verfier with code_challenge_method<br>and validate against code_challenge
  D->>B:Access token and refresh token
  B->>E:Request resource with access token
  E->>B:Response
  loop Refresh access token
    B->>D:Request new access token with<br>refresh token before expiry
    D->>B:New access token and new refresh token
    B->>E:Request resource with new access token
  end
```
