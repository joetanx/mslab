## 1. SecOps Overview

### 1.1. Key SecOps Functions

At a high level, an SOC is responsible for three key activities: monitoring, detection, and response.

These activities are interrelated and crucial to the success of the SOC's mission.

####  1.1.1. Monitoring

Continuous monitoring of an organization's networks, systems, and applications to detect potential security incidents is what monitoring entails.

Examining logs, analyzing network traffic, and reviewing alerts generated by various security technologies may all be part of this process.

Monitoring's goal is to detect potential threats and vulnerabilities as soon as possible so that the SOC team can take action to prevent or mitigate the impact of a security incident.

####  1.1.2. Detection

Detection entails analyzing data collected during monitoring to determine whether or not a security incident has occurred.

Analyzing log files, reviewing network traffic, and using threat intelligence to identify known attack patterns may all be part of this process.

When a security incident is discovered, it must be investigated to determine the extent of the damage and the steps required to correct the problem.

Following the resolution of the incident, recommendations must be made to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future.

The goal of detection is to identify security incidents as quickly as possible so that the SOC team can take corrective action.

####  1.1.3. Response

Once a security incident has been detected, response entails taking action to contain and remediate it.

It may be necessary to isolate affected systems, remove malware, and restore systems to a secure state.

The goal of response is to minimize the impact of a security incident and quickly restore normal operations.

For example, if a system is infected with ransomware, the response could include disconnecting the system from the network, quarantining the system, removing the ransomware, and restoring the system to its original state.

### 1.2. Challenges in SecOps

#### 1.2.1. Alert fatigue

Various security tools across network, endpoint, application and cloud security can generate thousands of alerts daily.

The rapid increase in volume can become overwhelming and contribute to alert fatigue, where analysts may overlook important alerts due to the background noise of **false positives** and **low-priority** alerts. 

This can result in analysts missing critical signals due to the overwhelming volume of alerts they must sort through, leading to severe security vulnerabilities if an alert is overlooked.

#### 1.2.2. Lack of skilled personnel

There is already a severe ever-growing skills gap in the cybersecurity industry, and security operations requires more qualified professionals with the skills needed to evaluate intricate security events, respond to incidents, and administer advanced security tools.

This shortage puts a strain on the existing workforce, an already understaffed SOC team may need help to keep up with the overwhelming volume of alerts generated by their security tools, possibly leaving critical events going undetected and the organization vulnerable to cyber threats.

This results in decline in morale and possible burnout as employees are overwhelmed and unable to keep up with the increasing responsibilities.

#### 1.2.3. Evolving threat landscape

Attackers are consistently using more sophisticated methods to bypass security defenses.

SOC analysts struggles to remain current on the most recent threats, vulnerabilities, and attack techniques.

This is exacerbated by the proliferation of newly developed technologies like cloud computing, the Internet of Things (IoT), and ML, each introducing new potential attack vectors.

#### 1.2.4. Tools integration

A typical cyber defense arsenal comprises a myraid of security tools across network, endpoint, application and cloud security for monitoring and response.

These tools needs to be integrated to correlate data and obtain a unified view of the security posture.

Integration difficulties can impede effective response and cause visibility gaps.

#### 1.2.5. Incident response time

Prompt response to security incidents is paramount for mitigating losses.

However, due to factors such as alert saturation, a lack of automation, and process inefficiencies, detection and response can be delayed.

Delayed response times means giving attackers plenty of time to move laterally within the network and possibly failing SLA compliance.

#### 1.2.6. Maintaining compliance

Organizations are subject to various regulations depending on their industry, such as GDPR/PDPA for data privacy, PCI DSS for credit card security, or CCOP for CII systems.

Ensuring compliance with these regulations while managing security operations is a challenging balancing act for SOC analysts.

#### 1.2.7. Lack of context

Security alerts by itself lack the context analysts need to make informed decisions.

Without understanding the broader context of an alert, such as the assets involved, their criticality, and their relationship to the overall business operations, analysts may not be able to prioritize and respond effectively, and identify patterns or trends in the data that might offer valuable insights.

#### 1.2.8. Limited budget

Resources are finite and SOCs usually operate with a limited budget; this restricts the ability to invest in modern technology, employ qualified personnel, and provide ongoing staff training.

This may result in inefficiency and reduced effectiveness within the SOC.

### 1.3. SecOps team structure

#### 1.3.1. Alert Analysts (Tier 1)

- First line of defense in SOC operations.

### 1.4. SecOps technologies

An SOC typically employs a variety of technologies and processes to support these activities. These could include:

#### 1.4.1. Security Information and Events Management (SIEM)

SIEM platform is the Central Intelligence Hub that collects, analyzes, and correlates security event data from various sources to detect potential threats. It serves as the foundation for visibility and incident detection. It provides real-time monitoring, forensic analysis, and alerting based on predefined rules and machine learning models.

#### 1.4.2. Security Orchestration, Automation and Response (SOAR)

SOAR integrates with various security tools to automate repetitive security tasks or orchestrate incident response actions such as threat containment and remediation  across different tools. Its augments the security operations team performance by reducing response time and improving efficiency.

#### 1.4.3. Threat Intelligence Platform (TIP)

TIP integrates with SIEM and SOAR to provide contextual insights on emerging threats, helping security teams prioritize incidents based on real-world intelligence.

It enhances detection and helps organizations proactively identify and mitigate threats.

#### 1.4.4. Network Security: Intrustion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDPS), Network Detection and Response (NDR) and Network Traffic Analysis (NTA)

Network security technologies analyze network traffic to protects the network.

They continuously monitor network behavior to identify anomalies, such as lateral movement or command-and-control traffic.

Alerts from IDPS can be fed into SIEM for further investigation.

#### 1.4.5. Extended Detection and Response (XDR) - including EDR and NDR

XDR enhances traditional endpoint and network security by integrating data across multiple security layers.

It provides broader threat visibility and automated incident response across endpoints, networks, and cloud environments.

#### 1.4.6. Cloud Native Application Protection Platform (CNAPP)

CNAPP provides comprehensive security for cloud workloads, integrating Cloud Infrastructure Entitlement Management (CIEM), Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM), and Cloud Workload Protection Platform (CWPP) to improve security posture and secure identities, configurations, and workloads in cloud environments.

#### 1.4.7. Vulnerability Management (VM)

VM solutions continuously scan and assess assets to identify security weaknesses. They prioritize vulnerabilities based on severity and potential impact, helping organizations remediate risks before exploitation.

#### 1.4.8. External Attack Surface Management (EASM)

EASM continuously scans and and secures externally exposed assets, such as cloud services, web applications, and third-party integrations.

It helps security teams understand their attack surface and identify misconfigurations and exposed assets that could be exploited by attackers.

## 2. Incident Response

### 2.1. Attack Lifecycle

Frameworks for analyzing cyber attack timelines:
- **Cyber Kill Chain**: seven-step model that outlines the typical stages of a cyber attack 
- **MITRE ATT&CK**: detailed matrix of tactics, techniques and procedures (TTP) used by adversaries

| Cyber Kill Chain Phase | MITRE ATT&CK (Enterprise) Tactics | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Reconnaissance | Reconnaissance | The attacker learns details about the target, including its IP address, network structure, and security measures. The attacker find weaknesses from reconnaissance data that can be used in the attack. |
| Weaponization | Resource Development | The attacker proceeds to weaponization after it has obtained enough knowledge of the victim. The attacker generates a malicious payload, such as a virus or worm, to take advantage of weaknesses found during the reconnaissance phase. |
| Delivery | Initial Access | The malicious payload is delivered to the victim, typically using phishing techniques such as email attachment or a website exploit. |
| Exploitation | Execution | If the delivery is successful, the payload will execute on the target and obtain access to internal systems. The attacker uses flaws in the systems establish a foothold. |
| Installation | Persistence,<br>Privilege Escalation | After initial access is obtained, the attacker establishes persistence mechanism such as backdoors to maintain access. |
| Command & Control | Command and Control | After a stable access is obtained, the attacker establishes remote control to compromised systems, typically via C2 and DGA techniques. |
|  | Defense Evasion,<br>Credential Access,<br>Discovery,<br>Lateral Movement | The attacker attempts to crawl deeper into the environment to seek valuable assets.<br>The Cyber Kill Chain does not explicitly define Lateral Movement as a separate step, it generally occurs after the initial breach when attackers seek to expand their access within the network. |
| Actions on Objectives | Collection,<br>Exfiltration,<br>Impact | The final goal where the attacker can achieve its objectives (e.g. monetary gains, reputation damage or political), typically:<br>• data theft - selling stolen data (monetary)<br>• system disruption - e.g. ransomware (monetary), denial of service (reputation damage or political)|

### 2.2. Incident Response Lifecycle

NIST SP 800–61 Revision 2 provides a structured approach to developing and implementing an efficient computer security incident response program.

It outlines a four-phase incident response process:

![](https://axaxl.com/fast-fast-forward/articles/-/media/axaxl/images/fast-fast-forward/2020/cyberincidentresponsecycle_axa-xl_graphic2.png)

#### 2.2.1. Phase 1: Preparation

Preparation focuses on readiness and involves setting up the foundation for effective incident response. Organizations establish policies, train personnel, and implement security measures to detect and handle potential threats.

- Developing and maintaining an incident response plan (IRP)
- Defining roles and responsibilities within the response team
- Establishing communication protocols (internal and external)
- Conducting regular training and simulation exercises
- Ensuring tools, technologies, and access controls are in place

#### 2.2.2. Phase 2: Detection & Analysis

Once a security event occurs, swift detection and accurate analysis are crucial.

- **Detection**: Identifying potential security incidents through alerts, logs, user reports, and automated monitoring systems.
- **Triage**: Assessing the severity and impact of detected incidents, such as correlating anomalous sequences against attack behavioral profiles (TTPs), to prioritize response efforts.
- **Investigation and Analysis**: Digital forensics to determine the nature, scope, origin, and methods of the attack. This often involves examining logs, traffic, endpoints, and indicators of compromise (IOCs).

#### 2.2.3. Phase 3: Containment, Eradication & Recovery

After identifying the threat, the focus shifts to neutralizing its impact and restoring normal operations.

- **Containment**: Short-term and long-term measures to limit the incident's spread and impact (e.g., isolating affected systems).
- **Eradication**: Removing the root cause of the incident, such as malware, unauthorized access, or vulnerable configurations.
- **Recovery**: Restoring systems and services to normal operation, while ensuring that systems are clean and monitored for signs of reinfection.

#### 2.2.4. Phase 4: Post-Incident Analysis 

After the incident has been resolved, reviewing lessons learned strengthens future defenses.

- **Analyzing Root and Contributing Causes**: Identifying what caused the incident and any underlying weaknesses.
- **Incorporating Lessons into Upgrades**: Using findings to update security policies, tools, procedures, and training.
- **Informing Strategic Decision-Making**: Feeding insights into broader organizational risk management and planning.

### 2.3. Security Automation

#### 2.3.1. Objectives in Security Automation

##### 1. Operational Efficiency

- **Standardization**: Playbooks establish consensus-tested standard operating procedures (SOPs) for consistent handling of generic incident categories. This reduces variation in practitioner responses over time, even with staff turnover. Documented playbooks ensure institutional knowledge stays within the SOC versus leaving with departed team members.
- **Scalability**: With playbooks defining how automated orchestration platforms (Security orchestration, automation, and response (SOAR)) should react based on trigger conditions, a small team can manage responses to a high volume of incidents. Playbooks encoded in workflow automation engines allow near-infinite incident processing without manual human bottlenecks up to compute resource limits.
- **Knowledge retention**: Institutional response wisdom remains captured in playbooks even as team members come and go. Playbooks help transfer tribal knowledge to new hires more reliably than manual shadowing, given consistent encodings. This boosts team resilience against turnover.
- **Reduced workload**: Automation allows security tools to triage alerts, filter out false positives, and prioritize the most critical incidents for analysts to review. This reduces the time analysts spend sifting through irrelevant data and allows them to focus on high-priority threats. Studies have shown automation can reduce workload by 30–50%.

##### 2. Agile Threat Detection and Response

- **Speed**: Playbook steps allow critical containment and investigation actions to launch immediately through programmed workflows without delay from manual processes or analyst approval bottlenecks. Automated playbook steps like isolating infected hosts or disabling compromised accounts execute at computer speeds orders of magnitude faster than waiting for human direction. This rapid response is critical given that attacker dwell times inside networks continue to shrink.
- **Efficiency**: Common incident types consuming standard analyst tasks like collecting forensic artifacts, querying threat intel feeds, or updating tracking tickets can transition to automated playbook executions, freeing up analyst bandwidth to handle more complex scenarios requiring human judgment and adaptability. Where machine consistency provides value, playbook automation maximizes the ROI of analyst creativity.
- **Flexibility**: As threats evolve, playbooks can be updated centrally, and changes immediately propagate refined response procedures enterprise-wide through SOAR deployment. Playbook revision control and modular design accelerate keeping responses aligned to emerging attacker behaviors and infrastructure shifts.
- **Improved threat detection**: Machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies powering automation are well suited for detecting subtle patterns and anomalies that may indicate a threat but are difficult for humans to spot manually. Automated tools continuously monitor diverse data sources, applying learned patterns to detect even stealthy threats between scanning intervals. This improves detection coverage compared to rule-based or signature-based tools alone.
- **Faster response times**: Predefined playbooks and integrations allow automated response actions to rapidly contain threats without waiting for analyst review in some cases. Automation shortens the mean time to respond (MTTR) and contains actively exploiting threats before they can cause damage. Faster response enhances the overall security posture.
- **Reduced human errors**: Automated tools eliminate human factors like fatigue, distraction, or lack of expertise that can lead to errors in judgment or missed threats. Properly configured automation is less prone to accidental oversights or failures to follow protocol during security incidents. This improves overall consistency and accuracy.

##### 3. Compliance and Audit Readiness

- **Tracking KPIs**: Automates performance metrics like Mean Time to Detect (MTTD) and Mean Time to Respond (MTTR), providing real-time insights into security effectiveness.
- **Auditability**: Security automation ensures a complete audit trail of case management and response activities, enhancing compliance, accountability, and transparency. Detailed playbook logging tracks actions taken during incidents (who took what actions, when, and why), facilitating reviews, root cause analysis, and post-breach gap identification for process improvements and playbook remediation.

#### 2.3.2. Automation Functions

##### 1. Alert Management & Prioritization

- **Triage and alert prioritization**: Automate initial alert processing, enrichment, scoring, duplication removal, and categorization to speed up assignation and investigation.
- **Orchestrating alert enrichment**: Integrate threat intelligence feeds and centralized asset management databases provides invaluable context, aiding accurate security event prioritization decisions. Analysts can quickly check indicators against aggregated industry observations about associated threat groups, ongoing global campaigns, malware code overlaps, and vulnerable software versions still in use across the infrastructure. This enrichment connects the dots between previously disjointed internal activities.
- **Escalation and notifications**: Standardize notifications to appropriate teams or individuals based on customizable rules accounting for factors like severity, categorization, and service level agreements (SLAs).

##### 2. Streamline Incident Response Workflows

- **Investigation and analysis**: Automate retrieval of data from EDR tools, security appliances, the SIEM, and other systems to quicken basic incident analysis so teams can focus on higher-value tasks.
- **Response playbook support**: Connect tools and platforms to provide comprehensive data inputs and the ability to trigger response actions outlined in SOC playbooks geared toward specific threats and incidents.
- **Automated containment**: Expedite frontline containment measures by categorizing affected device criticality, detection rule severity scores, known privilege levels already reached, and the type of data or applications impacted. Trigger containment actions including automatically disable user accounts, block suspicious IP addresses, isolate infected endpoints, roll back unauthorized system changes, disable remote access, and enact other rapid response steps according to established runbooks.

##### 3. Case Management & Collaboration

- **Case management and response activities documentation**: End-to-end orchestration workflows log all investigative and mitigation activities as structured case records, including timestamps, commands enacted, analyst notes explaining actions taken, interesting file attachments collected, and threat intelligence or vulnerability data referenced while working the event. Meticulously compiled incident records greatly aid subsequent caseload review for additional patterns, streamline detailed postmortem reporting for leadership, and provide measurable performance indicators around response efficiency critical for identifying budgetary and capability gaps.
- **Smoother technical handoffs**: When escalating complex incidents from one team to another (such as an SOC team transitioning an incident to forensics for further analysis), key data can be automatically passed between each group's respective tools rather than manually.
- **Automated ticket creation**: Automatically open tickets regarding security issues in service management platforms to streamline communication and assignment during incidents.

##### 4. Threat Hunting & Investigation

- **Threat hunting and identification**: Orchestrate threat intel gathering, correlation against historic data, and access to additional context from other tools to uncover advanced threats missed by preventative tools.
- **Data enrichment for threat hunting**: Orchestrate SIEM data correlation with enriched logs from endpoints, firewalls, domain name system (DNS) tools, and proxy appliances to uncover advanced threats.
- **Operationalize threat hunting**: SOARs provide an invaluable workflow automation backbone, allowing analysts to launch extensive hunt queries across the enterprise rather than just reacting to each alert in isolation. High-priority threat intelligence on novel attack tradecraft leaked from dark web sources or emerging sophisticated actor groups can be rapidly operationalized into enterprise-wide search, scan, and forensic procedures executed systematically across server logs, endpoint data, email stores, network traffic, and cloud infrastructure.

- Reduced mean time to detect threats signals enhanced vigilance in identifying malicious post-compromise activities faster amid the noise.
- A lower mean time to respond denotes improved prioritization and promptness in initiating investigations when novel alerts sound.
- Faster mean time to contain verifies upgraded protocols blocking wider adversarial spread after initial confirmations.
- Higher true positive rates over false positives indicate properly tuned analytics with minimized alarm fatigue.
- Wider containment automation coverage supplemented by human effort was still essential.
