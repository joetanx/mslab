## 1. SecOps Overview

### 1.1. Key SecOps Functions

> 1 Introduction to SOC Analysis → SOC Roles and Responsibilities

At a high level, an SOC is responsible for three key activities: monitoring, detection, and response.

These activities are interrelated and crucial to the success of the SOC’s mission.

####  1.1.1. Monitoring

Continuous monitoring of an organization’s networks, systems, and applications to detect potential security incidents is what monitoring entails.

Examining logs, analyzing network traffic, and reviewing alerts generated by various security technologies may all be part of this process.

Monitoring’s goal is to detect potential threats and vulnerabilities as soon as possible so that the SOC team can take action to prevent or mitigate the impact of a security incident.

####  1.1.2. Detection

Detection entails analyzing data collected during monitoring to determine whether or not a security incident has occurred.

Analyzing log files, reviewing network traffic, and using threat intelligence to identify known attack patterns may all be part of this process.

When a security incident is discovered, it must be investigated to determine the extent of the damage and the steps required to correct the problem.

Following the resolution of the incident, recommendations must be made to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future.

The goal of detection is to identify security incidents as quickly as possible so that the SOC team can take corrective action.

####  1.1.3. Response

Once a security incident has been detected, response entails taking action to contain and remediate it.

It may be necessary to isolate affected systems, remove malware, and restore systems to a secure state.

The goal of response is to minimize the impact of a security incident and quickly restore normal operations.

For example, if a system is infected with ransomware, the response could include disconnecting the system from the network, quarantining the system, removing the ransomware, and restoring the system to its original state.

### 1.2. Challenges in SecOps

1. Alert fatigue
    - false positive
    - low priority alerts
2. Lack of skilled personnel
3. Evolving threat landscape
4. Tools integration
5. Incident response time
6. Maintaining compliance
7. Continuous monitoring
8. Lack of context
9. Limited budget

### 1.3. SecOps team structure

> 2 SOC Pillars → Levels of SOC Analysts

#### 1.3.1. Alert Analysts (Tier 1)

- First line of defense in SOC operations.
- Monitor and analyze security alerts from various tools (SIEM, IDS/IPS, firewalls).
- Perform initial triage, validate alerts, and escalate genuine threats to Tier 2.
- Maintain documentation and update incident records.

#### 1.3.2. Incident Responsders(Tier 2)

- Handle escalated security incidents from Tier 1.
- Investigate security breaches, analyze malicious activities, and coordinate response efforts.
- Contain and remediate threats while minimizing business impact.
- Conduct forensic analysis and produce detailed incident reports.
- Perform preliminary forensic analysis by reviewing logs and alerts to identify suspicious activity.

#### 1.3.3. Threat Hunters (Tier 3)

- Handle escalated security incidents from Tier 2.
  - Conduct in-depth forensic investigations such as file analysis, malware reverse-enginer on compromised systems to uncover attacker methodologies.
  - Correlate forensic findings with threat intelligence to predict future attack trends.
- Proactively search for hidden threats within the network.
- Utilize threat intelligence and advanced analytical tools to detect anomalous behavior.
- Develop hunting methodologies to uncover sophisticated attacks like APTs (Advanced Persistent Threats).
- Work closely with Incident Responders and SOC Engineers to improve detection capabilities.

#### 1.3.4. SOC Engineers (and SOC Architects)

- Design, implement, and maintain SOC infrastructure and security tools.
- Ensure optimal configuration of SIEM, EDR, SOAR, and other security technologies.
- Develop automation and playbooks for efficient security monitoring and response.
- Continuously improve SOC performance and resilience through upgrades and optimizations.

#### 1.3.5. SOC Managers

- Lead and oversee SOC operations and strategy.
- Define policies, workflows, and security protocols.
- Ensure alignment with regulatory requirements and cybersecurity best practices.
- Coordinate communication between SOC and other departments (IT, legal, compliance).
- Manage team performance, training, and resource allocation.

### 1.4. SecOps technologies

An SOC typically employs a variety of technologies and processes to support these activities. These could include:

#### 1.4.1. Security Information and Events Management (SIEM)

SIEM platform is the Central Intelligence Hub that collects, analyzes, and correlates security event data from various sources to detect potential threats. It serves as the foundation for visibility and incident detection. It provides real-time monitoring, forensic analysis, and alerting based on predefined rules and machine learning models.

#### 1.4.2. Security Orchestration, Automation and Response (SOAR)

SOAR integrates with various security tools to automate repetitive security tasks or orchestrate incident response actions such as threat containment and remediation  across different tools. Its augments the security operations team performance by reducing response time and improving efficiency.

#### 1.4.3. Threat Intelligence Platform (TIP)

TIP integrates with SIEM and SOAR to provide contextual insights on emerging threats, helping security teams prioritize incidents based on real-world intelligence.

It enhances detection and helps organizations proactively identify and mitigate threats.

#### 1.4.4. Network Security: Intrustion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDPS), Network Detection and Response (NDR) and Network Traffic Analysis (NTA)

Network security technologies analyze network traffic to protects the network.

They continuously monitor network behavior to identify anomalies, such as lateral movement or command-and-control traffic.

Alerts from IDPS can be fed into SIEM for further investigation.

#### 1.4.5. Extended Detection and Response (XDR) - including EDR and NDR

XDR enhances traditional endpoint and network security by integrating data across multiple security layers.

It provides broader threat visibility and automated incident response across endpoints, networks, and cloud environments.

#### 1.4.6. Cloud Native Application Protection Platform (CNAPP)

CNAPP provides comprehensive security for cloud workloads, integrating Cloud Infrastructure Entitlement Management (CIEM), Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM), and Cloud Workload Protection Platform (CWPP) to improve security posture and secure identities, configurations, and workloads in cloud environments.

#### 1.4.7. Vulnerability Management (VM)

VM solutions continuously scan and assess assets to identify security weaknesses. They prioritize vulnerabilities based on severity and potential impact, helping organizations remediate risks before exploitation.

#### 1.4.8. External Attack Surface Management (EASM)

EASM continuously scans and and secures externally exposed assets, such as cloud services, web applications, and third-party integrations.

It helps security teams understand their attack surface and identify misconfigurations and exposed assets that could be exploited by attackers.
