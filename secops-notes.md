## 1. SecOps Overview

### 1.1. Key SecOps Functions

At a high level, an SOC is responsible for three key activities: monitoring, detection, and response.

These activities are interrelated and crucial to the success of the SOC’s mission.

####  1.1.1. Monitoring

Continuous monitoring of an organization’s networks, systems, and applications to detect potential security incidents is what monitoring entails.

Examining logs, analyzing network traffic, and reviewing alerts generated by various security technologies may all be part of this process.

Monitoring’s goal is to detect potential threats and vulnerabilities as soon as possible so that the SOC team can take action to prevent or mitigate the impact of a security incident.

####  1.1.2. Detection

Detection entails analyzing data collected during monitoring to determine whether or not a security incident has occurred.

Analyzing log files, reviewing network traffic, and using threat intelligence to identify known attack patterns may all be part of this process.

When a security incident is discovered, it must be investigated to determine the extent of the damage and the steps required to correct the problem.

Following the resolution of the incident, recommendations must be made to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future.

The goal of detection is to identify security incidents as quickly as possible so that the SOC team can take corrective action.

####  1.1.3. Response

Once a security incident has been detected, response entails taking action to contain and remediate it.

It may be necessary to isolate affected systems, remove malware, and restore systems to a secure state.

The goal of response is to minimize the impact of a security incident and quickly restore normal operations.

For example, if a system is infected with ransomware, the response could include disconnecting the system from the network, quarantining the system, removing the ransomware, and restoring the system to its original state.

### 1.2. Challenges in SecOps

1. Alert fatigue
    - false positive
    - low priority alerts
2. Lack of skilled personnel
3. Evolving threat landscape
4. Tools integration
5. Incident response time
6. Maintaining compliance
7. Continuous monitoring
8. Lack of context
9. Limited budget

### 1.3. SecOps team structure

#### Alert Analysts (Tier 1)

First line of defense, responsible for monitoring security alerts, filtering false positives, and escalating incidents that require deeper investigation

#### Incident Responsders(Tier 2)

Conduct in-depth assessments of security incidents, analyze attack patterns, and implement containment and recovery strategies

#### Threat Hunters (Tier 3)

Most experienced analysts proactively hunt for threats, investigate complex incidents, and develop advanced detection techniques

#### Digital Forensics Investigators

Sometimes performed by Incident Responders (Tier 2) as part of incident investigations or tier 3 analysts for more sophisticated cases

#### SOC Engineers (and SOC Architects)

Focus on designing, implementing, and maintaining the security infrastructure that supports the SOC team

### 1.4. SecOps technologies

An SOC typically employs a variety of technologies and processes to support these activities. These could include:

#### 1.4.1. Security Information and Events Management (SIEM)

SIEM platform is the Central Intelligence Hub that collects, analyzes, and correlates security event data from various sources to detect potential threats. It serves as the foundation for visibility and incident detection. It provides real-time monitoring, forensic analysis, and alerting based on predefined rules and machine learning models.

#### 1.4.2. Security Orchestration, Automation and Response (SOAR)

SOAR integrates with various security tools to automate repetitive security tasks or orchestrate incident response actions such as threat containment and remediation  across different tools. Its augments the security operations team performance by reducing response time and improving efficiency.

#### 1.4.3. Threat Intelligence Platform (TIP)

TIP enhances detection

TIP integrates with SIEM and SOAR to provide contextual insights on emerging threats, helping security teams prioritize incidents based on real-world intelligence.

It enhances detection and helps organizations proactively identify and mitigate threats.

#### 1.4.4. Intrustion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDPS)

IDPS technologies monitor network and system activities to detect malicious behavior and block potential attacks. Intrusion detection systems (IDS) alert security teams, while intrusion prevention systems (IPS) actively take measures to stop threats in real time.

#### 1.4.5. Network Traffic Analysis (NTA)

NTA tools analyze network traffic patterns to identify anomalies, malicious activities, and potential data breaches. They help detect advanced threats, including lateral movement and command-and-control communication.

#### 1.4.6. Extended Detection and Response (XDR) - including EDR and NDR

XDR enhances traditional endpoint detection and response (EDR) and network detection and response (NDR) by integrating data across multiple security layers. It offers advanced threat detection and automated response to improve security posture.

#### 1.4.7. Cloud Native Application Protection Platform (CNAPP) - including CIEM, CSPM, CWPP

CNAPP solutions provide comprehensive security for cloud applications, integrating Cloud Infrastructure Entitlement Management (CIEM), Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM), and Cloud Workload Protection Platform (CWPP) to secure identities, configurations, and workloads in cloud environments.

#### 1.4.8. Vulnerability Management (VM)

VM solutions continuously scan and assess assets to identify security weaknesses. They prioritize vulnerabilities based on severity and potential impact, helping organizations remediate risks before exploitation.

#### 1.4.9. External Attack Surface Management (EASM)

EASM focuses on identifying and securing externally exposed assets, such as cloud services, web applications, and third-party integrations. It helps organizations understand their attack surface and mitigate risks from shadow IT and misconfigurations.

## 6. Performance Metrics (10. SOC Metrics and Performance Measurement)

- Reduced mean time to detect threats signals enhanced vigilance in identifying malicious post-compromise activities faster amid the noise.
- A lower mean time to respond denotes improved prioritization and promptness in initiating investigations when novel alerts sound.
- Faster mean time to contain verifies upgraded protocols blocking wider adversarial spread after initial confirmations.
- Higher true positive rates over false positives indicate properly tuned analytics with minimized alarm fatigue.
- Wider containment automation coverage supplemented by human effort was still essential.
